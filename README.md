## Checklist: Parsing an Email Address in Java

Students should complete the following steps to implement a Java function that parses an email address and returns the first and last name:

- [ ] Create a new Java class (e.g., EmailParser).
- [ ] Write a function that accepts an email address string as an argument.
- [ ] Extract the portion before the '@' symbol (the username).
- [ ] Split the username by the '.' character to separate first and last names.
- [ ] Return the first name and last name as a single string (e.g., "firstname lastname").
- [ ] Test the function using sample email addresses (e.g., "john.doe@example.com" should return "john doe").
- [ ] Document your code with comments explaining each step.
